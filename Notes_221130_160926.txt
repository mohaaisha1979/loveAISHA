If there is a danger in loving somebody too much, then let me die for you, or better still, die in your arms if that is what it will take to show you that I love you. You are the sweetest and most annoying person I know, but I would never trade you for anything. Keep being you, and I will not hesitate to drag you to the aisle. I want to be your hero, the only man you trust to put his life on the line for you. Remember, you are worth more than anything I could ever lose for your sake. You are the one God created and set aside for me. He straight from above, and you understood the assignment. Babe, you are my remedy when I am stuck in the toughest situations and the only person I want to share my life with. I do not know how you always put me on the right track, sweetheart. I must admit that sometimes I assume your concern as nagging, but I also respect you

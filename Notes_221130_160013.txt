Words may fail to express how much I love you but my deeds will never fail to show my love for you. I loved you yesterday, love you today, and will love you until there’s no tomorrow!

Love is not something that you can express in words. Love is something that is expressed by actions and felt with the heart. I don’t know how much loved I make you feel but trust me, dear, you are the most precious thing in my life. I love you!

You have made me believe that fairytales are real. Thanks to you, we don’t even have to try, and it is always a good time when we are together. May God keeps blessing us, and hope has stored everything best for us. I love you, sweetheart.

You may not know, but there are eight wonders in this world. Only one of them is living in my heart, and reading this message among the seven others. Darling, you are the most beautiful sight in the whole universe. I love you with my everything!

You have made me realize how much power the word “love” holds, and definitely, you made me understand the true meaning of romantic love. Thanks for being such a kind, understanding, and generous human being. You inspire me a lot. Love you, baby girl.

A day without you makes me want the question of the existence of planet Earth. Dear love, you keep me going even on my most vulnerable days. Without you, I cannot breathe; without you, I am incomplete. I love you so much, babe.
